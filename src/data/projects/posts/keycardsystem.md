# Additional Comments

I am proud to say that I recieved 86% for this project. This project allowed me to understand the value of object orientated programming principles such as SOLID, and design patterns such as the observer pattern to communicate state updates, and the strategy pattern to change implementation at run time. I wrote unit tests for this project, however in the last year I can look back and say that my unit testing knowledge and process has improved greatly since this project.
