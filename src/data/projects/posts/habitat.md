## Additional Comments

This project was a great opportunity to collaboratively try out some new technology that my colleagues and I were raring to get our teeth into. The backend was built by my colleague using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and SQLServer. We built the front end using Angular8 & TypeScript, Ionic, and Cordova, to enable easy cross-platform deployment of the application. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this application, because it allowed me to utilise my web-development knowledge in a different context for a different platform. It was also my first experience using TypeScript, and using a more complex build pipeline to support multiple platforms.
