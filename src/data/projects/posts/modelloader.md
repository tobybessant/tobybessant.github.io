A console-driven model loader for rendering and viewing 3D models. Supports '.obj' and '.dae' files.

# Skills Developed
- Use of an unmanaged language, C++.
- Use of OpenGL and associated graphics libraries to render models from a file.
- Algorithms, to enable fast file parsing to quickly load large sets of data.
- Design patterns through the creation of an abstract loader interface for easy addition of new file types.

# Additional Comments

This project was my first C++ application, which came with its challenges. Working with an unmanaged language added complexities around memory manangement,
which became more challenging as the application grew. This became particularly important if the user loads larger files intno the application.
