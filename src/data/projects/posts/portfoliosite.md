# Additional Comments

This project was developed as an update to my old portfolio site. My initial portfolio site was a static HTML/CSS/JS site, which prevented it from being easily extensible. Since then I have learned how to use modern JS frameworks such as VueJS & Angular, which I knew would allow my website to be more maintainable. I chose to use VueJS for this site due to the fact that it is lightweight and fast to get up and running.
